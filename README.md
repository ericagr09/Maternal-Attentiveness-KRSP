# Maternal-Attentiveness
This repository contains all the data and code that was used during my 2023-2024 honors thesis project on maternal attentiveness. 

### Abstract
Balancing selection has been suggested to maintain phenotypic variation within populations. However, few studies have examined its role in maintaining variation in parental care, let alone investigating the causes and consequences of such variation in natural settings. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the phenotypic variation of maternal care in North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is maintained because its fitness benefits vary according to the environment, where selection on maternal care may fluctuate due to ecological variation. We conducted standardized nest disturbances in nursing female red squirrels in the Yukon, Canada. Nestling squirrels were temporarily removed from their natal nest for data collection. After returning the pups to the nest, we recorded two proxies of maternal care behavior: whether the mother returned to the nest containing her offspring and how long it took the mother to return to the nest. We then examined how these measures of maternal care behaviors correlated with annual (ARS) and lifetime reproductive success (LRS), as well as whether the association between maternal care and ARS depended upon key ecological variables (predator abundance, conspecific density, food availability). We found that for females who experienced a food pulse, those who were more attentive did not have higher LRS, but more attentive females had higher LRS if they did not experience a food pulse in their lifetime. Females who were more attentive only experienced an increase in ARS in years with lower food availability, indicating that there are fewer benefits of being attentive to pups in high resource years. This suggests that inter-annual fluctuations in food availability could induce fluctuating selection upon maternal care. We found no evidence that proxies of predation risk and conspecific density influence the association between reproductive success and maternal care. Future studies are needed to cement our conclusion that fluctuating selection is at work and support the finding that fluctuating selection can act over shorter time scales.
