This repository contains all the data and code that was used during my 2023-2024 honors thesis project on maternal attentiveness.

•	Lrs_data.csv – final data for LRS models

•	Nest_binary.csv – final data for models that use binary measure of maternal attentiveness (did mom return to the nest? Yes/no)
